MultiWii 2.2 based quadcopter controller
========================================

----

# MWC android controller
This is a very simple quadcopter controller following the MultiWii Serial Protocol(MSP).

Currently there is only the uplink communication to the MWC(MultiWii Copter), therefore the application doesn't know the copter's status.

The joystick UI is from mobile-anarchy-widgets and I am using MultiWii 2.2 for my base flight control.

The joystick UI can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/mobile-anarchy-widgets/wiki/JoystickView "mobile-anarchy-widgets").

Check out the [MultiWii website](http://www.multiwii.com/software) for other versions of MultiWii.

Anyone can use this code freely.
